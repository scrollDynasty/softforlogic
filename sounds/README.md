# Sound Files

This directory should contain the alert sound file:
- `alert.mp3` - Sound notification for profitable loads

Since we cannot include actual sound files in the repository, you need to:
1. Add your own alert.mp3 file to this directory
2. Or remove the sound alert functionality from the extension

The sound file should be:
- Format: MP3
- Duration: 1-3 seconds (short alert sound)
- Size: Under 1MB
